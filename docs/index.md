# Research Material Repository

This repository contains the material gathered during a research entitled _A Complementary Analysis of the Reaction about Modeling Problems on BPMN 2.0-based Tools_, authored by Jo√£o Vitor de Camargo, and advised by Prof. Dra. Lucineia Thom and Msc. Vinicius Dani.

!!! Warning "This is a ongoing research"
    This material is here available for research associates and reviewers.

Here you will find screenshots and descriptions of visual elements used by 10 process modeling tools to provide feedback about errors.

??? Info "The content of the models is not relevant"
    As the goal is to expose these modeling tools to problems, the content of the models _per se_ is not necessarily relevant. Furthermore, many models were created using labels in portuguese, which should not impact the visual feedback abour problems perceived.
